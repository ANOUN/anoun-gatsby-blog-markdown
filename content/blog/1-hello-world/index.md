TLDR;
We are in the business of making bold products and experiences that are designed so perfectly and so intentionally that you never have to ask for a user manual.

Hey! Welcome to our blog!

With this being our first post we really would like to do a couple things:

1. Introduce Ourselves

2. Explain what kind of content we'll be posting

## Norman Doors

So first of all we're <span class="anoun-title">ANOUN</span>. We're a creative design and development agency based out of Boise, Idaho. We believe that design is in everything whether it's a person, place, thing, or idea. Some things are absolutely designed better than others and the funny thing is design *should* be a thankless job. If you had to stop and think about how something is designed it's usually because it's getting in your way. For example, have you ever pulled on a door that you're supposed to push?

*Actually if you ever want to watch an interesting video on that check this out:*

>*In a nutshell that's our mission. We want to find problems like those doors and fix them so it makes sense without a user manual.*

## Words matter

We don't really see our customers as customers honestly. We see them more as business partners.
