Hey! Welcome to our blog!

With this being our first post we really would like to do a couple things:

1. Introduce Ourselves
2. Explain what kind of content we'll be posting

## Norman Doors

So first of all we're <span class="anoun-title">ANOUN</span>. We're a creative design and development agency based out of Boise, Idaho. We believe that design is in everything whether it's a person, place, thing, or idea. Some things are absolutely designed better than others and the funny thing is design _should_ be a thankless job. If you had to stop and think about how something is designed it's usually because it's getting in your way. For example, have you ever pulled on a door that you're supposed to push?

_Actually if you ever want to watch an interesting video on that check this out:_

> _In a nutshell that's our mission. We want to find problems like those doors and fix them so it makes sense without a user manual._

## No Fluff

We don't really see our customers as customers honestly. We see them more as business partners. If they succeed we succeed. it's that simple. You'll see with a lot of agencies it's about having a cool website, an amazing portfolio full of big corporate clients, and they'll have these big huge office buildings full of employees and expensive furniture. We're not like that. Not to say that's not awesome for them but it's just not us. We don't feel the need to convince people we're cool and it's 2019...you can work anywhere there's wifi and coffee these days.

## Our Blog

Now for what to expect on our blog!

We hope to be posting all sorts of content on here from tips and pointers on how to design a better looking website, how to increase traffic to your website, modern tools you should be using for your business, even FREE (yes free, no strings attached or email sign up required) web design and development resources. No matter what we end up posting here we just promitse it will follow these simple rules:

1. We will favor quality over quantity. Don't expect a post 3x a day like some blogs ðŸ˜‰
2. We **won't** require contact info for free content and tools
3. We will not be putting Google ads on our website (no matter how tempting it might be to make an extra dime off your clicks)

Also, at the bottom of every post will be a TLDR; or (too long didn't read). This will be a summary if you want to just cut to the chase and get the link or general idea of the article.

## Questions?

If you're in the market for a new web designer, new logo design, or just have some questions about who we are and think we might be able to help don't hesitate to reach out! Just hit the chat button in the bottom right or you can call, email, text, you know the drill!

## TLDR;

We are in the business of making products and experiences designed so perfectly and so intentionally that you never have to ask for a user manual. Our blog is going to be a place for high quality, useful, distraction free content.

Thank you for your time and we hope you have a blessed day!
