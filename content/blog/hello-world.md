Hey everyone. I’m so happy to be writing to you guys today. I have been racking my brain these past few weeks trying to figure out what my first post should be about. Then I realized that trying to come up with a great topic was a waste of time. I realized how much pressure I was putting on myself to write something sweet and interesting that you guys would just fall in love with. That I would say the right words and make it all look so good. The more I sat and tried to think of something, the more frustrated I became. Now all I’m thinking to myself is “Wow.”

So, here I am writing about something real. Something that was and still is sometimes, a struggle for me. Starting a blog has always been something I’ve dreamt of doing for as long as I can remember. It came apparent to me in my teenage years that I had a heart for sharing stories with people and hopefully be encouraging to them in some way. Especially after realizing in my own life just how hard and confusing life could be. First hand I would see people around me who felt stuck, who made a mistake and felt like they could never be anything more than that or maybe someone who had a dream but was too afraid to go for it.

It’s no secret between Jaydan and I that we both have so many dreams. Jaydan has a dream of starting his own business and I’ve always had a dream of starting my own blog. We both would just talk about it for so long. We’d talk about the things we want to do, the places we want to see and the people we want to meet. Honestly, we never really talked about them like they were too big to even say out loud. We declared them together. I would say “One day I will start a blog babe.” and he would say back to me “And I will start my own business.”

It is easy to say those things, right? To say we’re going to do something and not follow through? I’m speaking to myself here. Then we would contemplate for months saying things like “Well, where do we even start?” For a long time we felt stuck. We would try to come up with some kind of formula that we thought would magically work and end up being discouraged. Then we both realized… There isn’t one. There isn’t some big thing has to happen to get us to start following our dreams and living our life the best way we can.

For the longest time I thought I had to have all of the right tools and resources to be productive and if I was missing even one of them, I couldn't do it. I was focusing on all of the wrong things. It wasn't until after I moved away from home did I really understand what God has been trying to tell me for a long time. He showed me what true confidence in Him meant. That I don't have to be afraid and that when He gives you a heart for something, He is going to give you the resources. He gives me the confidence I need to share my story and my thoughts with people. He gives me the confidence I need to believe not only in myself but others. Even if people have let me down or have disappointed me. So, you may think to yourself, "How do I get to that point?"

You just decide one day that this is what you’re going to do. And you start from there. This applies to all aspects of our lives. You decide one day that you are going to forgive. That you are going to move on. That you are going to love. That you are going to go for that job you have been wanting. That you are going to go for that big dream or leave that place you think you’re trapped in. Because you know those people you see that you think have it all together? I’m going to let you in on a little secret. They don’t. No one does. We are all trying to figure life out. One step at at time.
